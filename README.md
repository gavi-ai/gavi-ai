# 👋 Yo, I'm Garvpreet — aka gavi-ai

I build AI agents, automation tools, and full-stack products that solve real problems — from scraping jobs to simulating interviews to building next-gen web apps.  
Currently diving deep into LangChain, OpenAI, Web3, and Python-based systems that actually *think* and *act*.
